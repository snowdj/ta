Version 0.2.1 of gh-pages-blog was just released.

This release includes updates to the \_config.yml file to reflect the recent change in github policy to start using github.io as the default domain for github pages instead of github.com. You can read more about this change [here](https://github.com/blog/1452-new-github-pages-domain-github-io).

The good news is that existing github.com links will auto forward to the new github.io domain. The configuration file was simply updated to reflect the change in policy and to be a responsive developer.
