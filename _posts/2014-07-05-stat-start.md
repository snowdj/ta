I am reviewing statistics.
I find very good online course.


### Statistics 110

### Harvard CS109 STAT121 AC209 E-109 Data Science Course.
http://www.cs109.org/

### R Tutorial: An R Introduction to Statistics
http://www.r-tutor.com/
  

Many concepts and formula are different from daily life. 

If I do not use them, I forget them quickly.

So everytime, I review those courses, I find they are new.

It is not fun if I need to finish my assignments.
