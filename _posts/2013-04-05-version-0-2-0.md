Version 0.2.0 of gh-pages-blog was just released.

### Bug Fixes ###

This release includes one bug fix where the author attributed on a post was not being rendered correctly on the individual post page.

### New Features ###

This release also includes one new feature, where the author attributions are included in the html header meta data on each page and post.

The site author and email that is configured the \_config.yml is always included in the html meta data. However, if a author and author\_email are included in the front matter of a page or post, then this author information will also be included in the html header meta data as well.

### Documentation ###

The [Getting Started]({{ site.url }}/user-manual/getting-started.html) page has been updated to include the user of the author and author\_email front matter tags on pages and posts.

Happy blogging.
